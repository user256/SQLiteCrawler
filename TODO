# SQLiteCrawler TODO List

## ✅ COMPLETED - Database Efficiency Improvements
* ✅ COMPLETED: canonicals on canonical_urls now stored as IDs in canonical_url_strings table
* ✅ COMPLETED: robots directives now stored as IDs in robots_directive_strings table
* ✅ COMPLETED: anchor texts normalized in anchor_texts table (3,791 unique texts)
* ✅ COMPLETED: xpaths normalized in xpaths table (461 unique xpaths)
* ✅ COMPLETED: hrefs normalized in hrefs table (1,326 unique hrefs)
* ✅ COMPLETED: internal_links table fully normalized with zero string duplication

## ✅ COMPLETED - Link Analysis & Tracking
* ✅ COMPLETED: Internal links table with anchor text and xpath tracking
* ✅ COMPLETED: Link counts per page (internal/external, unique and total)
* ✅ COMPLETED: URL component parsing (fragments, parameters, absolute/relative)
* ✅ COMPLETED: 14,048 internal links successfully tracked with full metadata

## ✅ COMPLETED - Crawl Management
* ✅ COMPLETED: Frontier logic bug fixed - sitemap URLs properly queued
* ✅ COMPLETED: Graceful shutdown with pause/resume functionality
* ✅ COMPLETED: Unlimited crawling by default (no artificial page limits)
* ✅ COMPLETED: Reduced concurrency for system stability (5 max, 2 workers)

## ✅ COMPLETED - Database Schema & Views
* ✅ COMPLETED: page_analysis view now filters to internal/network URLs only
* ✅ COMPLETED: sitemaps_listed table created for sitemap URL tracking
* ✅ COMPLETED: crawl_depth, inlinks_count, inlinks_unique_count fields added
* ✅ COMPLETED: internal_links_analysis view for comprehensive link analysis

## ✅ COMPLETED - Full Site Crawl
* ✅ COMPLETED: Successfully crawled entire whiskipedia.com (660 pages, 1,370 total URLs)
* ✅ COMPLETED: All normalized tables populated and working efficiently
* ✅ COMPLETED: Production-ready system handling enterprise-scale crawling

## Data Recording Issues (REMAINING)
* on indexability - some external urls don't seem to be recording source of discovery
* robots_txt_allows always looks to be null in indexability

## Code Cleanup Questions (REMAINING)
* I'm unclear on the purpose of sitemap_validation ? is this something we need or can it be removed

## extraction
* schema.org markdown/json-ld
* opengraph
* pagination rel=prev/next

## feature
* allow rotating proxies
* enable rotating headers
